# Add new entries to this file in the following format:
# {Source Character Fighter ID}, {Target Character Fighter ID}
# For instance, the following line...
# 	0x00, 0x2E
# ... would generate a Snake .sawnd with Mario's sounds and properties ported over.
# Importantly, a "smashbros_sound.brsar" file must be provided for this program to work,
# as all sound and sound property data is pulled directly from the contents of that file.
# Note: Any Fighter IDs not prefixed with "0x" will be read as decimal numbers.
# Note: Lines starting with a hashtag ('#') or a forward slash ('/') are ignored.
