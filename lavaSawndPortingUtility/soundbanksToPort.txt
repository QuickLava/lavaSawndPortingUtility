# Add new entries to this file in the following format:
# {Source Character Fighter ID}, {Target Character Fighter ID}
# For instance, the following line...
# 	0x00, 0x2E
# ... would generate a Snake .sawnd with Mario's sounds and properties ported over.
#
# Alternatively, you may add entries in the following format:
# {Source Character Internal Name}, {Target Character Internal Name}
# For instance, the following line...
#	Koopa, Snake
# ... would generate a Snake .sawnd with Bowser's sounds and properties ported over.
#
# Note: Any Fighter ID not prefixed with "0x" will be read as a decimal number.
# Note: Internal Names are the names used on characters' Fit____.pac files (eg. "FitMario.pac").
# Note: Lines starting with a hashtag ('#') or a forward slash ('/') are ignored.
